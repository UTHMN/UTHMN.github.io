    <h1 id="how-india-was-affected-by-the-british-empire">How India was affected by the British Empire</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>During the British Empires Reign, India was a British colony. The British Empire was a global empire consisting of 56 countries that spanned between the late 16th century and the early 19th century<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. While the British Empires reign over India resulted in advancements in infrastructure<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>, education<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>, and healthcare, it also resulted in the displacement of the native population through economic exploitation and political struggles.</p>
<h2 id="indias-infrastructure-changes">India's infrastructure changes</h2>
<p>India's infrastructure was greatly affected by the British Empire. One example of this is the railways created by the British Empire. During the British Rule, they constructed multiple railways with a motive of supporting their goals of the British empire in the colonies<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The railways were usually built to transport goods, and first began operation in 1853<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The first passenger train in India was built on the 16th April 1853<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup> and ran between Bori Bunder (Bombay) and Thane (34 km)<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>. It was operated by three engines, named Sahib, Sultan and Sindh<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>, and had thirteen carriages<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In 1880, the Oriental Telephone Company and the Anglo-Indian Telephone Company asked the Goverment of India to create a telephone a telephone exchange in India. Permission was refused to prevent a government monopoly on telephone networking and the government itself should create the network. In 1881, the government later reverted its decision and a licence was granted to the Oriental Telephone Company to open telephone exchanges at: Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai and Ahmedabad and the first telephone service was established in the country.<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="educational-changes-in-india">Educational changes in India</h2>
<p>The British Empire had a significant impact on the educational system in India. Examples of this include the introduction of the British education system in India, the establishment of the first university in India, and the introduction of English as the medium of instruction in schools.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Under the British Empire's reign, University was only accessible to upper classes. This is because of high fees, You have to speak English, and the and the universities were concentrated in urban areas. This resulted in the education system being dominated by the upper class and more Indians speaking English, which has also impacted India today.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="economical-changes-in-indiasup8sup">Economical changes in India<sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup></h2>
<p>Under the British Empire's reign, the economy of India was heavily influenced by the British Empire. These influences include:</p>
<p><u> <strong>India's Change into a economic colony colony</strong> </u><br>
The British used India's resources as a source of raw materials and a market for their goods. This harmed local industries and farmers, who were unable to compete with the British.</p>
<p><u> <strong>Decline of the Textile Industry</strong> </u><br>
British policies led to a decline in Indian textiles, as machine-made textiles by the British flooded the market for cheaper. Heavy tarrifs on Indian goods and free access for British goods led to de-industrialization in India.</p>
<p><u> <strong>Exploitative Land Revenue Laws</strong> </u><br>
Lots of laws about land revenue were made to extract as much money from Indian farmers as possible leading to distress and lack of food.</p>
<p><u> <strong>Commercialization of Farming</strong> </u><br>
The introduction of lots of cash crops in India such as tea, coffee, cotton, sugarcane and oilseed led to more food shortages</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the British Empire's rule over India resulted in a significant impact on the country's infrastructure, education, and economy. On one hand, the British introduced significant advancements such as railways, telecommunications and universities that contributed to industrialization and modernization. But on the other hand, these changes were primarily made to serve the interests of the British Empire, leading to economic exploitation, for example the food shortages caused by the commercialization of agriculture.</p>
<p>The British Education System also further divided India's society, with the upper classes receiving better education and opportunities, while the lower classes were left behind. Economic policies also led to the decline of local industries leading to the decline of local industries like the textile industry and farming.</p>
<p>While some aspects of British rule contributed to modernization, the overall impact was one of economic exploitation and social disruption. The legacy of British reign can still be seen today in India's infrastructure, legal system, and English-language dominance, but it also left behind deep economic and social scars that took decades to recover from.</p>

Company Ltd. approached the Government of India to establish a telephone exchange in India. Permission was<br>
refused on the grounds that the establishment of telephone networking was a government monopoly and that the<br>

<p>University education under colonial rule remained primarily accessible to urban elites and upper castes. High fees, English-language requirements, and the urban<br>
concentration of institutions created significant barriers for most Indians. The system effectively produced what some scholars have termed a “comprador<br>
intelligentsia”—Western-educated Indians who could serve as intermediaries between colonial authorities and the broader population.</p>
